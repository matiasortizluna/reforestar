ReflorestAR

“ReforestAR” is a native augmented reality mobile application for iOS and Android devices, which allows the user to place virtual trees on horizontal surfaces and, with that, simulate a real experience of a reforestation plan. This behavior is achieved through an algorithm that respects several minimum distances between trees. The application also allows users to customize the experience with specific options, such as modifying the scale, type, and quantity of trees to be placed. It even has functionalities to save and load the progress of a reforestation session. “Reforestar” was implemented as a final project of the degree course, later published as a scientific article and in the process of being submitted on the AppStore.

The iOS version was developed my myself while the Android version by my colleague Enrico.

Along with my colleague, we wrote “ReforestAR – An Augmented Reality Mobile app for Reforest Purposes", a paper presented at the B-ranked conference, "VISIGRAPP: 17th International Joint Conference on Computer Vision, Imaging and Computer Graphics Theory and Applications" on February 6, 2022. Published by INSTICC through its SciTePress digital library. Available for free download at: https://www.scitepress.org/Papers/2022/108332/108332.pdf
